A newly-installed proton irradiation site at the [Bonn isochronous cyclotron](https://www.zyklotron.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/zyklo_e/index.html) at the [Helmholtz Institut f√ºr Strahlen- und Kernphysik (HISKP)](https://www.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/) allows radiation damage studies of prototype silicon detectors for state-of-the-art, high-energy physics experiments such as [**ATLAS**](https://atlas.cern/) and [**BELLE 2**](https://www.belle2.org/). Especially pixel detectors are positioned close to the interaction point due to their high spatial resolution and tracking capabilities. Therefore, they are exposed to a harsh radiation environment which dictates their lifetime. In order to verify that the detectors meet requirements, radiation damage studies are necessary for prototype detector concepts.

### Topic: Development of a Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) for Online Beam Loss- and Profile Measurements

- Type: Bachelor
- Location: SiLab, HISKP
- Contact: [Pascal Wolf](mailto:wolf@physik.uni-bonn.de)
- Description: The primary proton beam, provided by the Bonn isochronous cyclotron, is extracted through a so-called _Lenard_ window to the irradiation site. Shortly before extraction, the absolute beam current, which is the crucial quantity for damage studies, is measured via a secondary electron monitor (SEM). In order to detect beam loss between SEM and extraction due to e.g. misalignment, a dedicated beam loss monitor (BLM) is needed. The BLM is planned as a custom _Lenard_ window with integrated _Faraday_ cup in the form of a graphite ring. The aim is to construct the BLM in a computer-aided design (CAD) program, test it's functionality in a test beam and integrate its data into an existing data monitor. Additionally, the BLM can be used to measure the beam profile at extraction.

### Topic: Development of an Online Radiation Damage Monitor Using Commercial Silicon PIN-diodes

- Type: Bachelor
- Location: SiLab, HISKP
- Contact: [Pascal Wolf](mailto:wolf@physik.uni-bonn.de)
- Description: The most prominent consequence of radiation damage for the operation of silicon detectors, is the increase in _leakage current_. This effect can be used to quantify the damage induced by a particle at its respective energy. Consequently, commercial silicon diodes can be irradiated to measure the radiation damage. The aim of this work is to establish a radiation damage monitor (RDM) which measures the damage on a "per irradiation" basis. A mount for the diode (BPW34F PIN-diode) has to be constructed and integrated in the existing setup. Automated measurement of the leakage current, using a source measure unit (SMU), and following interpretation/visualization of the data have to be implemented and integrated into an already existing Python software. A test irradiation is planned to verify the procedure.
