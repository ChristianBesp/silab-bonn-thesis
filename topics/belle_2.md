The [**BELLE 2**](https://www.belle2.org/) particle collision experiment in Japan started taking data in spring 2019. A european collaboration led by Germany developed the pixel detector (PXD) for particle tracking and vertex determination in the experiment. The sensors of the PXD are based on **DE**pleted **P**-channel **F**ield **E**ffect **T**ransistors (DEPFETs). The SiLab group has been involved for 10 years in the investigation of this technology and the development and testing of the final components.

### Topic: Characterization of Detector Modules for the PXD 2 Upgrade

- Type: any
- Location: SiLab
- Contact: [Botho Paschen](mailto:paschen@physik.uni-bonn.de)
- Description: A replacement/upgrade of the entire PXD is planned in the spring of 2021. A small number of detector modules will be characterized in Bonn. Characterization includes electrical and functionality tests of the **A**pplication **S**pecific **I**ntegrated **C**ircuits (ASICs) on the modules and optimization of the sensor response with radioactive sources. If possible also improvements of the testing procedures (mostly steered by Python scripts) and development of new tests will be part of the work.

### Topic: Investigation of Radiation Hardness and Radiation Burst Events of PXD ASICs and Sensors

- Type: any
- Location: SiLab
- Contact: [Botho Paschen](mailto:paschen@physik.uni-bonn.de)
- Description: The PXD has to withstand a large amount of ionizing radiation in the experiment. To investigate the effects on the ASICs and the sensors, dedicated irradiation campaigns with high intensity X-ray tubes and electron sources are planned starting this fall.
